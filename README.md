# STAT184-Final-Project

Combined two data sets, one being global alcohol consumption and the other being global quality of life in countries. Combined both data sets and looked at data from 2020 about alcohol consumption (litre per 100,000), happiness index, GDP per capita, and life expectancy. Found that alcohol has no evident correlation to most of these variables and other factors may be at play. Alcohol consumption could be an indicator for a country's happiness level.
